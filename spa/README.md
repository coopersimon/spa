## Known Bugs
- GB audio freq clock is incorrect.

## Odd things
- DMA seems to use unaligned addresses in both metroids. It also seems to be very much intentional
    - What is the expected behaviour here?
    - Looks like accesses should just be force-aligned to word or halfword addresses.
- Loads of unaligned memory accesses.
